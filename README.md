# Implicit Nil Return in Ruby Methods

This repository demonstrates a common error in Ruby: forgetting to explicitly return a value from a method.  When a method lacks an explicit `return` statement, it implicitly returns `nil`. This can lead to unexpected behavior and difficult-to-debug issues.

The `bug.rb` file shows the problematic code. The `bugSolution.rb` file provides the corrected version.
